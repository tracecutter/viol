   ``C-c C-=``              Adjust/rotate  or promote/demote the decorations
   ``C-- C-c C-=``          reverse Adjust
   ``C-c C-a C-d``          Display the title decoration hierarchy.

Titles are under- (and over-)lined (decorated) by ``=*-^"~`:.'#`` as below.  The
exact order of the decoration is not important, the one below is the
`Python convention <http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#sections>`_. ::

  Subsubsection
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  Paragraph
  """""""""

  Normal paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

.. _Transition:

A ``=`` with overlines is very often preferred to a ``*`` with
overlines for chapters. The previously quoted
`Python development guide
<http://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#sections>`_ while
advising to use stars uses internally equal character.

`Docutils documentation <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/>`_ uses
overlined ``=`` for parts, overlined ``-`` for chapters, ``=`` for sections,
``-`` for subsections, back quotes (`) for subsubsections.

Transition
----------
Any repetition of 4 or more punctuation characters with preceding and trailing
blank line is a transition, and looks like this:

      *Sphinx* use literal blocks to :ref:`highlight source code

      with a  bold font by *Sphinx* while being not interpreted by
      *rst2html*.

      *Sphinx* users better use a :ref:`code block <code_block>` in
      ``text`` language, to disable *Pygment* decorations.

Blocks
======

.. _literal_block:

Literal Block
-------------

:restref:`rest literal blocks <restructuredtext.html#literal-blocks>`

A block which is not interpreted at all is preceded by a ``::`` and a blank
line. The block must be indented.  If no white space is preceding the
``::`` then it is displayed as ":".

To use a specific formatting, you can use the :ref:`code directive <rst-code>`

Block one::

   **No** interpretation of
   |special| characters.

Another block! ::

   In the text body,
      indentation is
   preserved


.. index::
   single: block; line
   single: quotes; line block

Line blocks
-----------

In a line block (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#line-blocks>`)
every line is preceded with ``|`` and at least one space.

| Line block
| New line and we are still on
  the same line
|   Yet a new line

.. index::

.. _blockquote:

Block quote
-----------
.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      indenting them more than the surrounding paragraphs.

         Neither from itself nor from another,
         Nor from both,
         Nor without a cause,

         --Nagarjuna - *Mulamadhyamakakarika*

         .. pull-quote::

            Just as a solid rock ...

         .. highlights::

            With these *highlights* ...


Block quotes (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#block-quotes>`) are
created by just indenting them more than the surrounding paragraphs.

    Neither from itself nor from another,
    Nor from both,
    Nor without a cause,
    Does anything whatever, anywhere arise.

    --Nagarjuna - *Mulamadhyamakakarika*

An optional attribution can be set by a line beginning by two or three
minus signs flushed left at the level of the quote.


.. index::
   pair:directive; pull-quote

.. _pull-quote:

Pull-quote
----------

Pull-quotes  (:restref:`ref <directives.html#pull-quote>`)
are similar to blockquotes but are :ref:`directives <rest_directives>`

.. pull-quote::

  Just as a solid rock is not shaken by the storm, even so
  the wise are not affected by praise or blame.

.. index::
   single: blockquote; epigraph
   single: blockquote; highlights
   directive; epigraph
   directive; highlights


.. _epigraph:

Epigraph and highlights
-----------------------

An `epigraph` directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#epigraph>`) and an
`highlights` directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#highlights>`)
are aimed to put a quotation in a distinct font.

*dont forget the final* **s** *of highlights, or you fall down on the*
:ref:`Sphinx code highlighting directive <code_highlighting>`

.. highlights::

   With these *highlights* we have completed the Rest blocks.

These three directives are similar in
html  rendering to :ref:`blockquote` but with a `class` of ``pull-quote``,
``highlights`` or ``epigraph`` that your css may use *but default css
does not!*

.. index::
   block; container
   pair: directive; container

.. _container:

Container
---------
.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      .. container:: myclass

         There is also a general ...

.. container:: myclass

   There is also a general :restref:`container directive
   <directives.html#container>` whose unique effect is adding some class
   name to the block that your css may use. In html this paragraph
   is enclosed in a

   .. code-block:: html

      <div class="myclass container">  ... </div>

.. index::
   pair: directive; class


.. class_directive:

Class
-----
.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      .. class:: myclass

      The class directive ....

.. class:: myclass

The class directive (:restref:`ref <directives.html#class>`) add a
class on its content or on the first immediately following non-comment
element.  The name of the class is normalized by docutil to conform to
the regexp: ``[a-z](-?[a-z0-9]+)*``.

.. note::

   While the docutil tool ``rst2html`` put as expected the previous
   paragraph in a::

     <p class="myclass">....</p>

   Sphinx *as far as 1.2pre* does not put any class on the ``<p>``
   element. The use of a :ref:`container` is presently better suited
   to  apply a css decoration.

      ===========  ================

Simple tables (:restref:`ref <restructuredtext.html#simple-tables>`)
are preceded and ended with a sequence of "``=``" to indicate the
columns, e.g:

==  ==
aA  bB
cC  dD
==  ==

Headers are indicated by another sequence of "``=``", e.g:

=====  ======
Vokal  Umlaut
=====  ======
aA     äÄ
oO     öÖ
=====  ======

Column spans are followed by a sequence of "``-``" (except for the last header
or last row of the table where we must have "``=``"), e.g:

=====  =====  ======
Inputs        Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False         False
------------  ------
True   False  True
False  True   True
True          True
============  ======

Simple table cells are treated like a small document on their own up to line
breaks, but the first column must contain a single line.
e.g:

===========  ================
1. Hallo     | blah blah blah
               blah blah blah
               blah
             | blah blah

LaTeX table rendering
---------------------

Rendering with *:index:`tabulary`*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Sphinx use the latex package `tabulary
<http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/tabulary/tabulary.pdf>`_
to render tables in laTeX.

Tabulary is an extension of the *tabular* package which calculate le width
of columns; it has four new formats specifications: ``LRCJ`` for Left
(Right, Centered, Justified) column with automatic width.

Sphinx uses by default ``L``, but you can override it with a directive
like::

    .. tabularcolumns:: |L|C|C|R|

As examples in this document the re:`source code directives table
source_code_directives` which has a proper Sphinx automatic rendering
in tabulary ``|L|L|``, which adapt the column size with a wider left one.

The two first :ref:`simple tables <simple_tables>` the :ref:`csv table
<csv_tables>` and the :ref:`list table <list_tables>` are also
rendered in `tabulary` with a proper calculation of table width by
latex.

Rendering with *:index:`tabular`*
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tables that contain any kind of lists, such as object descriptions,
blockquotes, or literal blocks are set by default with the `tabular
<http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Tables#The_tabular_environment>`_
environment with equal column size, you can taylor the rendering by
giving `tabularcolumns` directive which uses the `p{width}` column
type.

An example is the following :ref:`source code include table
<source_code_include>`
which use both description and verbatim for wich the automatic
Sphinx rendering in latex is::

   \begin{tabular}{|p{0.475\linewidth}|p{0.475\linewidth}|}

If necessary we can adapt the relative length of columns.

Hypertext links
---------------
There exist two version for doing this.  Either in a citation style or in an
inline style.

.. sidebar:: Code for examples

   ::

      A link to `Sphinx Home`_ in citation style.

      .. _Sphinx Home: http://sphinx.pocoo.org

      In-line versions are
      `Sphinx Home <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_
       or `<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_
      or (in Sphinx) http://sphinx.pocoo.org


Citation style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A link to `Sphinx Home`_ in citation style.

.. _Sphinx Home: http://sphinx.pocoo.org

In printed documents the link will be listed similar as a citation, as opposed
to HTML documents.

In-line style
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In-line versions are `Sphinx Home <http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ or
`<http://sphinx.pocoo.org>`_ or (in Sphinx) http://sphinx.pocoo.org

   reference

.. _internal:
.. _ref:

internal document reference
---------------------------
To define ``label`` as label for any text location internal to a document,
precede the text location with::

   .. _label:

plus a blank line.

A ``:name:`` option in any block is also an internal reference target.

There are two ways of referencing a label.

.. _rest_ref:

The :restref:`reST way
<restructuredtext.html#hyperlink-targets>`
is::

    `label`_

The *preferred* `Sphinx way
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/latest/markup/inline.html#cross-referencing-syntax>`_,
allows linking across files, it  uses::

   :ref:`displayed text <label>`

it is specific to Sphinx and :ref:`you find it in the Sphinx section
<sphinx_cross_references>`.

Section titles, footnotes, and citations automatically are link targets.
```Transition`_`` produces `Transition`_. But they don't work with the
:ref:`Sphinx ref syntax <sphinx_ref>`.

If you want to change the displayed text with the
:ref:`ReST ref syntax <rest_ref>`
you can use an indirect
reference. You can then also reference the `Transition`_ section
as `how to draw an horizontal line`_ with
the hyperlink: ```how to draw an horizontal line`_`` and the
indirect target::

  .. _how to draw an horizontal line: Transition_

.. _how to draw an horizontal line: Transition_

      .. [REL09] Citation

``.. [REL2009]`` is followed by the definition of the citation ``REL2009``.  It
is referenced as ``[REL2009]_`` or ``REL2009_``.  Citation labels can contain
underlines, hyphens and fullstops.  Case is not significant.  In Sphinx,
definition and reference can reside in different files.

Rest Directives
===============

:restref:`Directives <directives.html>`
are a general-purpose extension mechanism.  The general syntax is
similar to `explicit_markup`_::

   .. ‹name›:: ‹argument 1›
               ‹argument 2›
      :‹option 1›: ‹value›

      ‹body›

The reST directives are detailed  in the
:restref:`docutils reference: reStructuredText Directives
<directives.html>`

.. here we reference

   :ref:`table of contents
   <reST-tableOfContents>`,  :ref:`image`, :ref:`figure`,
   :ref:`replacement <replacements>`, :ref:`file include
   <file_include>`, :ref:`sidebar, and topic <sidebar>`,
   :ref:`rubric`.

-----------------

Create a :restref:`table of contents
<directives.html#table-of-contents>`
containing (sub)titles ranging from level 1 to
level ‹number› if you use the ``:local:`` option the TOC is local to
the section where it appears, otherwise it is for the whole file, the title may be empty::

Images and LaTeX export
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reST command `rst2latex` use the width an hight of images and
figures but
the Sphinx laTeX exporter use also ``\includegraphics`` to import the figure;
but (as a far as Sphinx 1.2pre) it does not use the width and height
attribute.

To get proper figure size in latex generated by Sphinx you may have either to

   - resize the figure before including it,
   - use the ``:scale:`` option that is supported and generates a latex
     ``\scalebox``
   - or put a distinct laTeX code in an ``raw:: latex`` directive that
     use something like::

       \includegraphics[width=60mm, height=40mm]{myfig.png}

Latex does not support svg and it has to be converted to eps or pdf,
pdf being the only one to support transparency.
The conversion can be done with  Inscape, it can be automated as `explained by Johan B. C. Engelen
<http://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive/info/svg-inkscape/InkscapePDFLaTeX.pdf>`_.
You can also use the `ipe drawing editor
<http://ipe7.sourceforge.net/>`_.

code blocks
-----------

:restref:`ref: code directive <directives.html#code>`

::

   .. code:: ‹language›
      :linenos:

      ‹body›

is the ReST directive which is called in python
:ref:`code-block` or :ref:`sourcecode <code-block>`.

You must use ``code-block`` or ``sourcecode`` with Sphinx
and the  ``code`` with ReST utilities.

ReST use the same :ref:`code highlighting <code_highlighting>` than
Sphinx, look at  :ref:`Sphinx code highlighting <code_highlighting>`
to learn about the ways to specify it.

See also: `docutil FAQ: How can I represent esoteric characters?
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#how-can-i-represent-esoteric-characters-e-g-character-entities-in-a-document>`_.

General replacements::

   .. |something| replace:: here we
      define what something is.

.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      .. |more-doc| replace::  *more in* **reST** *directives manual*
      .. _more-doc: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/doc...
      .. |copy|   unicode:: U+000A9 .. COPYRIGHT SIGN

       Instead ...  use ``image`` |more-doc|_
       ... include unicode characters like |copy|.

Here ``|something|`` will be replaced by its definition.

.. |more-doc| replace::  *more in* **reST** *directives manual*
.. _more-doc: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#replacement-text

Instead of  ``replace`` you can also use ``image`` |more-doc|_

It is the only way  for nesting inline markup to create styled references
like we did  *above*.

.. |copy|   unicode:: U+000A9 .. COPYRIGHT SIGN

We also use substitutions to include unicode characters like |copy|.

If you use sphinx there are also three :sphinx:`predefined substitutions
<markup/inline.html#substitutions>`:
``|release|``, ``|version|``, ``|today|``.

.. index::
   pair: include; directive
   file include

.. _file_include:

file includes
-------------
To include a reST file use::

.. include:: subdir/incl.rst

You can put the file wherever you want the relative paths are
interpreted relative to the source directory.

The options: ``start-line``, ``end-line``, ``start-after``, ``end-before``
as referenced in :restref:`reST Directives
<directives.html#including-an-external-document-fragment>`.

For including source code in Sphinx rather use :ref:`Source code include
<source_code_include>` like:

If you use ``include`` with Sphinx, you should exclude the included
files from the source file lookup, by setting in ``conf.py`` a
glob pattern in ``exclude_patterns``, like::

   exclude_patterns = ["include/*"]


.. index::
   sidebar
   topic

.. _sidebar:

sidebar, and topic
------------------
A :restref:`sidebar
<directives.html#sidebar>`
or a :restref:`topic <directives.html#topic>`  are treated like documents on
their own::

   .. sidebar:: ‹Title›

      ‹body›

   .. topic:: Topic Title
      :name: mytopic

      Subsequent indented lines comprise
      the body of the topic, and are
      interpreted as *body elements*.

.. index:: topic

.. topic:: Topic Title
   :name: mytopic

   Subsequent indented lines comprise
   the body of the topic, and are
   interpreted as *body elements*.

.. index:: rubric

.. _rubric:

rubric
------
A :restref:`rubric
<directives.html#rubric>`
is a title not appearing in the table of contents::

   .. rubric:: ‹Title›


.. index::
   comment

.. _comment:

Comment
-------

.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      .. Comment
         Even more comment

      Not comment anymore

Everything starting like a directive with two periods and a space but is
followed by normal text is a comment.  Mark the indentation in the example:

.. Comment
   Even more comment

   Not comment anymore

.. _common_options:

Common options
--------------

The class options ``:class:`` and ``:name:``
are supported by most of the directives.

The following topic render in html as::

  <div class="exceptional topic" id="say-no-more">
  <p class="topic-title first">the end</p>
  <p>A final word.</p>
  </div>

.. sidebar:: Code for example

   ::

      .. topic:: The end
         :class: exceptional
         :name: say-no-more

         A final word.


The ``:name:`` act as a reference target and allow to refer to the following
block as `say-no-more`_

.. topic:: the end
   :class: exceptional
   :name: say-no-more

   A final word.
