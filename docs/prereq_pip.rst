Pip Installation
----------------

The Python community has settled on **pip** as the standard packagaing and
distribution mechanism.  Once you add pip to your Python system you can download
and install any compliant Python software product with a single command. It also
enables you to add this network installation capability to your own Python software
with very little work.  Pip builds upon **Setuptools**, and provides both
install and uninstall support.  Pip also provides for installation from locally
hosted packages and offers VCS integration.

To install pip (and setuptools), run the Python script available here:
`get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
